**1. Introduction**



A B S T R A C T


Developing new drugs is costly, time-consuming, and risky. Drug-target affinity (DTA), indicating the binding
capability between drugs and target proteins, is a crucial indicator for drug development. Accurately predicting
interaction strength between new drug-target pairs by analyzing previous experiments aids in screening potential drug molecules, repurposing them, and developing safe and effective medicines. Existing computational
models for DTA prediction rely on strings or single-graph neural networks, lacking consideration of protein
structure and molecular semantic information, leading to limited accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that
string-based methods may overlook protein conformations, causing a high root mean square error (RMSE) of
3.584 in affinity due to a lack of spatial context. Single graph networks also underperform on topology features,
with a 6% lower confidence interval (CI) for activity classification. Absent semantic information also limits
generalization across diverse compounds, resulting in 18% increment in RMSE and 5% in misclassifications
within quantifications study, restricting potential drug discovery. To address these limitations, we propose **G-K**
**BertDTA**, a novel framework for accurate DTA prediction incorporating protein features, molecular semantic
features, and molecular structural information. In this proposed model, we represent drugs as graphs, with
a GIN employed to learn the molecular topological information. For the extraction of protein structural
features, we utilize a DenseNet architecture. A knowledge-based BERT semantic model is incorporated to
obtain rich pre-trained semantic embeddings, thereby enhancing the feature information. We extensively
evaluated our proposed approach on the publicly available benchmark datasets (i.e., KIBA and Davis), and
experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method, which consistently outperforms
[previous state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/AmbitYuki/G-K-BertDTA.](https://github.com/AmbitYuki/G-K-BertDTA)



Drug-target affinity (DTA) refers to the binding ability between
drugs and their targeted proteins, which reflects the degree of binding
between drugs and their target molecules [1]. It is one of the important indicators for drug efficacy and new drug development [2]. The
higher the DTA, the tighter the binding between drugs and targets,
and the stronger the therapeutic effect of the drug [3]. Therefore,
accurate prediction of DTA can assist in screening more potential drug
molecules, providing new targets for disease treatment, and assisting
in repurposing new drugs [4,5]. This can also guide drug dosage,
administration methods, and treatment time, thereby improving the
efficacy and safety of drugs [6].
Currently, numerous computational models have been developed
to forecast drug-target affinity [7,8]. One common approach is to

calculate the interaction forces between drug molecules and target
molecules [9,10] to predict the affinity between them. An alternative strategy involves analyzing the tridimensional structure of target
molecules and predicting drug molecule conformation [11] to establish
their association with the target [12,13]. Quantum chemistry calculations can also be used to analyze the quantum mechanical interactions
between drug targets and protein compositions. For example, density
functional theory (DFT) can simulate and quantify the intermolecular forces dictating binding affinity, such as hydrogen bonds, charge
transfers, and _ùúã_ -stacking [14]. However, the computational complexity
of DFT limits throughput, with typical predictions taking upwards of
five hours per drug-target complex [15]. Compared to data-driven
deep learning techniques that can evaluate thousands of candidates
within minutes with better accuracy (MSE of 0.21), this approach

hinders high-volume screening. Additionally, large amounts of drugtarget affinity data can be collected and used as input strings for
binary classification [16] or regression problem [17] analysis. Deep
learning models have achieved notable advancements in predicting
drug-target affinity [18,19], leading to the development of various
algorithms based on drug-target interactions (DTI). They are computationally efficient and accurate in prediction [20], and are playing
an increasingly important role in drug discovery [21,22]. However,
most of the above models are based on the structural information of

protein strings and ignore the spatial structural information of the
target molecule [23,24]. More recently, graph-based DTA models have
been proposed [25], which consider both the structural information
of proteins and drugs. The simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) is a standardized method for representing molecules as
strings of characters. The SMILES molecules contain multidimensional
feature relationships of target information, which can better calculate
molecular properties and molecular docking information [26], and
facilitate the model to search for and learn molecular structure features.

The aforementioned models use the SMILES molecule information as

input for the graph structure in the graph neural network (GNN)
and leverage convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract higherdimensional molecular features of proteins [27]. Unlike models that
primarily rely on string-based structural information, graph-based approaches are capable of concurrently processing both SMILES data
and protein structural information, thereby achieving more accurate
predictions.

Existing methods mainly rely on graph neural networks (e.g., GNN,
GCN, and GAT) to process SMILES formulas [28]. However, these
models can result in the loss of vital information [29] and cannot consider the spatial order information [30] in the SMILES sequence [31],
hindering the exploration of dependence relationships between various
chemical bonds and chiral molecules [32]. Furthermore, the graph
networks utilized in these methods cannot fully utilize the topology
information of drug molecules [33]. To overcome these challenges,
we utilized the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) to acquire features
from SMILES molecule information [34]. In comparison to GCN and
GAT, which only consider local node features [35‚Äì37], GIN focuses on
the global feature representation of the graph, enabling the learning
of comprehensive spatial order, chiral, and topology information in
SMILES formulas [38].

The state-of-the-art (SOTA) drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction
approach ignores the semantic information between molecules [39].
This leads to the model‚Äôs inability to fully extract the complex features
of the molecule [40]. Integrating semantic information can aid in
detecting the correlation between drugs and targets [41]. For instance,
certain specific functional groups in a drug molecule‚Äôs chemical structure can predict its interaction with specific targets [42]. Additionally,
it can improve generalization ability [43] and enable better handling
of diverse SMILES molecule structures [44,45].

To enhance the accuracy of DTA prediction, we introduce the **G-**
**K BertDTA** framework. This model comprehensively integrates protein
feature information, molecular semantic features, and structural data
of molecules. In this framework, we utilize a GIN model to learn the
topological data of SMILES molecules and derive features for molecular
structure analysis. Additionally, we propose a novel DenseSENet architecture tailored for protein feature extraction that contains DenseNet
and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks. DenseNet enables representational reuse through dense-layer interconnections. After that, We
integrate SE blocks to re-calibrate channel-wise feature importance.
We also leverage knowledge-based BERT (KB-BERT), a pre-trained
language model based on bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers, to extract semantic features of SMILES molecules. These
features collectively enhance the completeness and accuracy of our
predictions. We then concatenate these embeddings and input them
into the output layer to calculate affinity. This approach effectively
integrates protein feature information, molecular semantic features,
and molecular structural information to improve DTA prediction.

The key contributions of our work are summarized as follows.

  - To address the high dimensionality and spatial complexity of

protein features, we have redesigned and improved the DenseNet
network, called DenseSENet. Leveraging the advantages of information flow and feature reuse in DenseNet, we also introduce the
SE blocks to adaptively learn channel weights and adjust the activation level of feature maps. The SE blocks evaluate and select the
importance of feature channels, enhancing the salient features for
classification tasks. Our DenseSENet effectively utilizes features
from all previous layers and captures important features from
protein sequences.

  - To enhance high-dimensional feature extraction from molecular

structures using SMILES formulas and address the issue of missing
node labels, we employ an improved graph isomorphism network
(GIN) to capture high-dimensional relational features between
isomorphic SMILES structures. By learning the topological representation of molecules, the GIN network can further improve the
understanding of SMILE‚Äôs structural characteristics and adaptively
learn the features of the graph. Furthermore, we employ CNNs
for additional feature dimensionality reduction, enabling a more
targeted focus on critical features.

  - Through the KB-BERT semantic model, we learn the semantic

features of SMILES representation and consider important features that were previously ignored in predicting molecules. This
enhances the accuracy and robustness of our model, enabling it
to better predict the essential characteristics of molecules. To
the best of our knowledge, no prior model network has been
specifically designed for extracting semantic information from
SMILES molecular formulas.

  - We design a specific framework based on graph representation

learning and pre-trained semantic embeddings for precise prediction of drug-target affinity. We extensively evaluate our framework and compare it with SOTA DTA methods. Our method
demonstrates a significant improvement, with a confidence interval (CI) increase of 0.019 and a decrease in mean squared error
(MSE) to 0.12, compared to the baseline method, respectively.
These results indicate that our method will contribute to the ad
vancement of medical research and the development of safe and
effective drugs. Our GraphDTA model has general applicability
beyond drug-target affinity prediction, as it can be applied to
any similar problem that involves graph-based data input with
semantic features.


The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Preliminaries and the
proposed framework are provided in Section 2. A brief overview of the
related work is provided in Section 3, then the experimental findings
and ablation investigations are presented in Section 4. Finally, we draw
a conclusion in Section 5, and the overall diagram of our proposed
framework is in Fig. 1.


**2. Materials and methodology**


_2.1. Data collection_


We utilized DAVIS [46] and KIBA [47] to evaluate the performance
of our proposed model. Both datasets are commonly used benchmarks
in drug-target interaction prediction and are widely recognized in the
field. The DAVIS dataset consists of 68 drug-protein pairs and 442
SMILES targets [48]. The KIBA dataset comprises a combination of
different biological activity data for kinase inhibitors, such as Ki, Kd,
and IC50 [49]. We filter the dataset for drugs and targets that have at
least ten interactions, resulting in 229 unique proteins and 2111 unique
drugs [50]. We provide an overview of the datasets in Table 1.

Furthermore, the predictive capabilities of our G-K BertDTA approach demonstrate strong generalizability across BindingDB [51],
Therapeutic Target [52] [53], and DrugMAP [54] datasets. BindingDB
is a publicly accessible database of measured binding affinities focusing on the interactions between proteins considered to be drug

contains 1,735,582 binding data entries for 7352 protein targets and
770,124 small molecules. [2] By compiling a vast amount of quantitative data on protein-ligand binding affinities, BindingDB enables
better understanding and prediction of interactions important for drug
discovery.
Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) [56] is a drug target database
that provides information about known and explored therapeutic protein and nucleic acid targets, targeted diseases, pathway data, and the
corresponding approved, clinical trial and experimental drugs. [3] As of
2022, TTD contains over 3500 drug targets and 38,000 drug molecules.
For each target, TTD integrates data including the target‚Äôs sequence,
pathway, disease, structure information, associated drugs, and clinical
trials.

DrugMAP [54] is a new dataset that describes the molecular portraits and drug information. It provides a complete list of interacting
molecules for over 30,000 drugs/drug candidates and gives the differential expression patterns of over 5000 interacting molecules in various
disease sites, [4] ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) related organs, and physiological tissues. Furthermore, an
extensive and accurate network containing over 200,000 interactions
between drugs and molecules has been compiled.

The consistency index (CI) is an essential metric in evaluating the
predictive performance of DTA [23,25]. It measures the concordance
between the estimated binding affinity scores and the true values for
drug-target pairs. We use paired t-tests with a 95% CI to handle statistical significance, and CI is widely employed to measure the degree
of prediction of binding strength values in protein-ligand interactions
relative to true values. The formula used to compute CI is given below.

**Fig. 3.** Framework for protein feature extraction using DenseSENet architecture. The
protein sequence is both input and encoded. DenseNet extracts features, which are
weighted by the SE blocks to enhance salient features.


Table 3. We first process the feature extraction of protein structure
by improving the basic principles of protein feature extraction-related
networks by combining DenseNet [57] and SE blocks [58,59]. For
the feature extraction of SMILES molecular formulas, we use multiple graph neural network models and process SMILES into graphs
for input into the following models. Then, we extract the semantic
information features of protein molecular formulas by integrating the
KB-BERT [39]. Finally, we introduce the feature interaction and model
learning process.
In protein structure feature extraction, we convert the protein sequence into an amino acid sequence and encode it into a numerical
sequence. We use a DenseNet model to extract features from the protein
structure. The DenseNet model can access the feature maps of all
previous layers, effectively reusing previous features, and this dense
connection can reduce the loss of feature information. Each layer can
also access the feature maps of all previous layers, enabling the model
to achieve the same performance as a traditional CNN with fewer layers
and parameters. The implementation is as follows.


_ùêª_ _ùëô_ = _ùê∂ùëúùëõùë£_ [([] _ùê∂ùëúùëõùëêùëéùë°_ [(] _ùêª_ 0 _, ùêª_ 1 _,_ ‚Ä¶ _, ùêª_ _ùëô_ ‚àí1 _, ùêª_ _ùëô_ )]) _,_ (5)


where _ùëã_ is the input protein sequence represented as a numerical
vector encoding the amino acid sequence. This serves as the input data
for feature extraction. _ùêª_ _ùëñ_ denotes the feature map of the _ùëñ_ th layer,
this captures the feature representations learned by each convolutional
layer from the protein sequence. [(] _ùêª_ 0 _, ùêª_ 1 _,_ ‚Ä¶ _, ùêª_ _ùëô_ ‚àí1 _, ùêª_ _ùëô_ ). from the 0th to
( _ùëô_ ‚àí1)th convolutional layers. These represent the hierarchical features
learned by each preceding _ùëêùëúùëõùë£_ layer. Concat() aggregates the feature
maps from all previous _ùê∂ùëúùëõùë£_ layers along the channel dimension, and
Conv() is done in each conv layer to extract features and transform the
representations.
We introduce SE blocks to improve the performance of the original
DenseNet neural network, resulting in a novel architecture termed
DenseSENet. We build upon prior works like Hu et al.[58] that first
adopted SE blocks to recalibrate channel interdependencies in CNNs

[60]. However, such methods focused solely on computer vision tasks

[61]. We now uniquely tailor and verify this mechanism for genomics
data, quantifying marked gains in affinity prediction accuracy. For
example, our experiments in the KIBA dataset demonstrate over 3.4%
CI score improvements from the unified DenseSENet topology.
Furthermore, no existing technique has optimized information flow
based on protein structural properties to integrate SE-driven feature
focusing. We establish new benchmarks by designing dense shortcuts
and targeted squeezing strategies according to sequence length variability and binding behavior patterns. The SE blocks incorporate both
a squeeze operation and an excitation operation, aiming to enhance
the network‚Äôs performance by adaptively recalibrating the importance
of channel-wise features in Fig. 3.



_Computers in Biology and Medicine 173 (2024) 108376_


The squeeze operation in DenseSENet employs global average pooling to condense the feature maps of each channel into a scalar value.
Subsequently, the excitation operation employs fully connected layers
to learn channel-specific weights and apply them to the original feature
map. We integrate the squeeze operation after the final convolutional
layer of each dense block in the DenseNet model, followed by the
inclusion of the excitation operation. The squeeze operation can be
expressed as follows.

_2.4. Molecular structure representation learning_



Protein structure features can be extracted through dense convolution feature extraction, and the weight information in protein structure
features can be enhanced by using the Excitation block, which can
improve the model‚Äôs ability to learn protein features and provide
strong support for drug development. In the feature extraction part of
SMILES molecules, we convert SMILES molecular formulas into molecular graph structures to extract more accurate features. We construct the
molecular graph by mapping the atomic and bond symbols from the
SMILES molecular formula to their respective atoms and bonds. This
representation facilitates the extraction of node and edge features by
the graph neural network, efficiently capturing the molecule‚Äôs graph
structure in Fig. 4.

GIN encodes the features of nodes and edges through the encoder
and combines the encoded node and edge features into a feature vector
of the molecule graph structure according to certain rules, which is then
fed into the graph model to learn and obtain higher-dimensional feature
embeddings of the molecule graph structure. Finally, we concatenate
the feature embeddings obtained from the graph structure neural network learning algorithm with the features from other pathways. The
formula is as follows.


_‚Ñé_ _ùê∫_ = ‚àë _‚Ñé_ [(] _ùê∫_ _[ùêæ]_ [)] [(] _[ùë£]_ [)] (10)

_ùë£_ ‚àà _ùê∫_


The _‚Ñé_ _ùê∫_ output is used to obtain the relevant feature information
of the SMILES molecular formula. The graph structure model GIN
can consider the position information of different molecular structure
components and preserve chemical features to a great extent.

language processing tasks, including text classification, entity recognition, and question-answering systems. External knowledge sources,
such as knowledge graphs, are integrated into KB-BERT to enhance
semantic understanding and reasoning abilities by incorporating entity
and relationship information. By extracting SMILES molecule structure, function, and interaction embeddings, we can obtain essential
parameters like affinity, interaction patterns, and mechanisms of action
between drugs and targets in Fig. 5. These parameters can provide
critical feature guidance and decision-making for the model‚Äôs next
round of learning through backpropagation.
In BERT semantic feature extraction, the sequence of SMILES
molecules can be converted into text by transforming the amino acid
sequence of its components into strings and then segmenting them.
The KB-BERT is used for pre-training. The amino acid string is then
input into the model for encoding to obtain vector representations
of each amino acid and max pooling is used to obtain the vector
representation of each amino acid. Thus, we can obtain a fixed-length
vector representation for representing the semantic information of the
entire protein molecule.
The input representation of the BERT model includes token embeddings, segment embeddings, and position embeddings, which can be
represented as follows.


_ùëí_ = _ùëíùëöùëèùëíùëëùëëùëñùëõùëî_ ( _ùë•_ ) + _ùëíùëöùëèùëíùëëùëëùëñùëõùëî_ ( _ùëùùëúùë†ùëñùë°ùëñùëúùëõ_ ) (12)


Among them, _ùë•_ is the input token sequence, _ùëùùëúùë†ùëñùë°ùëñùëúùëõ_ represents the
position of the token in the sequence, and _ùëíùëöùëèùëíùëëùëëùëñùëõùëî_ is a learnable
token and position embedding segment matrix.

Here, the representation of a node _ùë£_ in the _ùëò_ th layer is denoted
as _‚Ñé_ [(] _[ùëò]_ [)]
_ùê∫_ [(] _[ùë£]_ [)][, where] _[ ùëä]_ [(] _[ùëò]_ [)] [ is the weight matrix of the] _[ ùëò]_ [th layer.][ Óà∫] [(] _[ùë£]_ [)]
represents the set of neighboring nodes of node _ùë£_, _ùë•_ _ùë£_ is the feature

denotes the representation of the entire graph _ùê∫_ .


_2.5. SMILES semantic understanding_


The pre-training of the model on large volumes of unlabeled text
data allows it to learn rich language knowledge and semantic representation. KB-BERT can be fine-tuned and applied to various natural

**Fig. 6.** Framework for SMILES semantic understanding using KB-BERT. The SMILES formula is converted to text and input to the pre-trained KB-BERT model. KB-BERT encodes
semantic knowledge and outputs an embedding representing molecular semantics.



Subsequently, we substitute the learned _ùë•_ into the transformer
encoding and decoding layer.


_ùëß_ [(] _[ùëô]_ [)] = _ùëôùëéùë¶ùëíùëüùëõùëúùëüùëö_ [(] _ùëß_ [(] _[ùëô]_ [)] + _‚Ñé_ [(] _[ùëô]_ [)] [)] (14)


Where _ùë•_ [(] _[ùëô]_ [‚àí1)] is the output vector of the previous layer, _ùë§_ _[ùëû]_ _, ùë§_ _[ùëò]_ _, ùë§_ _[ùë£]_ is a
learnable parameter matrix and offset vector, _‚Ñé_ [(] _[ùëô]_ [)] is the output of multihead self-attention and layer normalization, and _ùëß_ [(] _[ùëô]_ [)] is the output of
position-wise feed-forward networks and layer normalization. The KBBERT model incorporates attention mechanisms and knowledge graph
representations that are primarily sourced from external knowledge
bases.

The external knowledge base can be represented as a matrix _ùëò_,
with each row corresponding to a vector representation of a knowledge
point. Among them, _ùëö_ represents the number of knowledge points, and
_ùëò_ _ùëñ_ represents the vector representation of the _ùëñ_ knowledge point. To
enhance BERT‚Äôs semantic understanding ability, an external knowledge
base vector representation can be concatenated with the input representation of the BERT model. This results in improved representations by
utilizing external knowledge-based information.


_ùëã_ _ùëíùëõ‚Ñéùëéùëõùëêùëíùëë_ = [[] _ùëã_ _ùêµùê∏ùëÖùëá_ _, ùêæ_ []] = [[] _ùë•_ 1 _, ùë•_ 2 _,_ ‚Ä¶ _, ùë•_ _ùëõ_ _, ùëò_ 1 _, ùëò_ 2 _,_ ‚Ä¶ _, ùëò_ _ùëö_ ] (15)


We combine the nodes of the sentence and the knowledge graph
into a new set of nodes in Fig. 6. Then, we treat the input sequence
as a designated node in the knowledge graph, which is input into kbattention as matrix _ùê¥_ to model graph information. We compute the
weighted feature vector, apply a function to map it, and output to
obtain the representation of each node.


_ùë¶_ = _ùëúùë¢ùë°ùëùùë¢ùë°_ [(] _ùëã_ _ùëíùëõ‚Ñéùëéùëõùëêùëíùëë_ _, ùê¥_ [)] (16)


In the feature interaction stage, we combine the embeddings extracted from the three components. We use feature cross to merge the
generated embeddings and employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for
prediction. This ensures that all features related to convolutional and
graph structures, as well as semantic features, are fully captured and
utilized.

_3.1. Feature extraction of protein structure_


Currently, most CNN-based methods for extracting protein structural features are based on CNN to extract molecular strings. These



models learn embeddings [62] from the three-dimensional organization
of proteins to study target affinity [63]. However, CNNs are limited to
extracting only local features, making it challenging to capture longrange dependencies and extract comprehensive protein features. This
limitation can hinder the accuracy of protein structure prediction. Kim
et al. [64] propose the use of CNNs for prediction in combination
with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, RNNs require input
sequences of fixed length, which limits their applicability to protein
sequences of varying lengths [65], leading to a loss of important
features. KronRLS method [66] explains the 2D composite similarity of
drugs. Due to the complexity of calculating the similarity matrix, it is
limited to the drug-target composite structures in the protein database
(PDB) list, limiting the number of molecules used in the training process. In addition, support vector machines (SVM) [67], random forests
(RF) [68], and deep neural networks (DNN) [69] have also been applied
to research related to affinity calculations. However, the above methods
have not fully explored the important features of proteins and cannot
represent complex molecular structural information.


_3.2. Molecular graph network feature learning_


Graph models represent interactions between substances as a graphical structure of nodes and edges [70]. By learning node features
(the chemical properties of atoms) and edge features (the chemical
properties of bonds), graph models can better predict the affinity between drugs and targets [71,72]. Sun et al. [73] convert the structural
information of chemical molecules into numerical features based on

the idea of graph structures, while Jiang et al. [74] investigate the
impact of including additional properties, activities, and toxicities of
molecules on processing and analysis. Hung et al. [75]found that
molecules of different shapes may also have similar structures and
functions, which are often overlooked. Clark et al. [76] use graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) to explore drug information, while Wu
et al. [77] utilize graph structures to fuse multi-modal learning of drug
structure information to jointly learn relevant features of molecules
and then use GCNs to predict affinity. Qian et al. [78] propose a new
deep-learning method to predict drug-target affinity. Previous studies
have shown that graph neural networks can predict drug-target interactions by extracting representation information from SMILES molecular
formulas. However, limitations in model performance arise from the
insufficient exploration of SMILES molecular formula features and the
lack of utilization of spatial order information in SMILES sequences and
topological properties of drug molecules.

_3.3. Molecular semantic information acquisition_


Several recent methods have been proposed for extracting semantic
information from molecular formulas. Winter et al. [79] introduce a
feature representation method that uses low-level encodings of chemical structures. By converting semantically equivalent but syntactically different molecule structures into a common representation, their
method can extract semantic features for any new molecules, and use
them as descriptors for semantic feature learning. Krenn et al. [80]
propose the SELFIES model, which is based on Chomsky type-2 model
algorithms and includes self-referencing functions. Zhang et al. [81]
introduced the knowledge graph embedding (KGE) method and attempted to integrate the molecular structure information of entities
into KGE, using text and graph structure-based embeddings as inputs
for the model. However, the generalization capabilities of the KGE
method remain limited despite its usage. Zeng et al. [82] and Malas
et al. [83] attempt to integrate related knowledge graph content into
molecules. While these models improved the prediction performance,
the generated compounds lacked clinical explanations and were not
suitable for biological research and optimization. However, to the
best of our knowledge, no prior models are specifically designed for
extracting semantic information from SMILES molecular formulas.


**4. Results**


_4.1. The performance of G-K BertDTA_


We evaluate the performance of the K-G BertDTA model on the
DAVIS and KIBA datasets by computing the CI and MSE values, respectively. Experimental results indicate that our model outperforms
other state-of-the-art Graph-DTA [25] prediction methods in both KIBA
(Table 5) and Davis (Table 4) benchmark datasets, with significant
improvements in MSE and CI values.
Furthermore, the predictive capabilities of our G-K BertDTA approach demonstrate strong generalizability across diverse datasets.
As highlighted in Table 6, we evaluated performance on BindingDB
for protein information, TTD Dataset for molecular structures, and
DrugMAP for SMILES semantics. Our framework, despite covering
various data modalities and representation types, set new benchmarks
by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all sources, marked by the
lowest RMSE and highest CI. For instance, on the text-based DrugMAP
set, we attained extremely high-affinity quantification precision with
an RMSE of 1.597.

Our approach involves a comprehensive design of feature selection
and interaction processes to achieve this objective. Regarding the feature selection process, we modify DenseNet with the addition of SE
blocks [58] for extracting protein features. The DenseSENet demonstrates superior capabilities in protein feature extraction. The Dense
blocks architecture in the network allows direct access by convolutional

of SE blocks enables the network to adaptively learn the significance
of each channel, enabling it to focus more on meaningful features for
specific tasks, thereby enhancing its ability to discriminate and extract
important protein features.
The scattering plot compares the true and predicted drug-target
binding affinities of 2000 samples from different datasets. Our model
achieves a remarkable correlation with the ground truth affinities, as
evidenced by the tight clustering of points along the diagonal and the
high _ùëÖ_ [2] score of 0.91 in Fig. 7.

Fig. 8 gives an illustration of loss convergence over 300 epochs
during model training and validation. The high convergence of predictions to the true diagonal line demonstrates the strong predictive
capability of our model across diverse drug-target combinations from
multiple datasets. The minor vertical deviations from the diagonal
further indicate small errors in the predictions. Additionally, the colorcoding by dataset labels shows highly consistent performance on both
datasets. This suggests strong generalization ability across different
domains. These quantitative results validate the precise affinity prediction capability of our model on heterogeneous real-world data. The
robustness across datasets highlights the potential for practical drug
discovery applications.
Node labels are typically manually defined, which introduces errors
and uncertainties, especially in the context of extracting features from
SMILES molecules. Unnecessary errors can negatively impact the accuracy of the model. The GIN outperforms other graph neural networks in

handling missing or inaccurate node labels, as it does not rely on node
labels. Moreover, GIN is capable of better extracting high-dimensional
relational features between isomorphic SMILES structures, a capability
that other graph neural networks lack. However, GIN primarily focuses
on embedding extraction for the overall graph structure, potentially
limiting its ability to capture detailed feature representations. To address this limitation, we further enhance the GIN by applying CNNs
to reduce the embedding dimension from 1024 to 256, disregarding
unimportant details and focusing on essential features to improve
prediction accuracy.
Our framework incorporates KB-BERT for DTA prediction. The introduction of KB-BERT enriches the model‚Äôs understanding and utilization of semantic information in SMILES molecules. By pre-training the
KB-BERT model, we can integrate a vast amount of knowledge pertaining to the physical and chemical properties of SMILES molecules,
such as solubility and pharmacokinetic parameters, into the model. This
pre-training equips the model with a deep understanding and learning
capability of these properties. KB-BERT also leverages molecular fingerprint technology [99] to extract semantic features from SMILES formulas, further enhancing the model‚Äôs representation of SMILES molecule
semantics. These semantic features contribute to capturing the relationships between molecular structures, functionalities, and properties,
thereby improving the model‚Äôs performance in predicting the affinity
between drugs and targets.


_4.2. Generalizability across different functional features_


The experimental results presented in Table 6 demonstrate the
superior performance of our approach across different domains of
drug-target affinity prediction, including protein information, molecular structure, and SMILES semantics. For protein information, our
method achieves a lower RMSE of 2.627 compared to state-of-the-art
techniques like TEFDTA (2.829) and ColdDTA (3.137) on the BindingDB dataset. The higher CI score of 0.668 also indicates a more
accurate ranking and quantification of binding affinities relative to true
values.

This superior performance stems from the ability of our DenseSENet architecture to effectively extract salient features from protein
sequences. By densely connecting convolutional blocks and reusing
prior feature maps, DenseNet captures comprehensive protein information without loss across layers. The additional SE blocks further
evaluate each channel and focus on the most relevant features through
dynamic calibration, filtering out unnecessary details. This leads to
more discriminative learning of protein signatures that dictate binding
behavior.

For molecular structure representation, we again outperform methods such as 3DProtDTA and GraphDTA on the Therapeutic Target
Database, achieving the lowest RMSE of 1.968 and the highest CI of
0.734. The topological graph representations derived from our GIN
model provide significant advantages in embedding molecular structures. GIN overcomes issues with missing node labels and learning
limitations of other graph networks by focusing on global isomorphic
patterns instead of local node semantics. This property enables broader
generalization across diverse molecular graphs. The subsequent CNN
dimension reduction also concentrates embeddings on the most salient
chemical features related to drug binding affinity. Our largest gains
come in SMILES semantics, where pre-training with external knowledge
delivers major improvements. Our approach outperforms existing methods like Rm-LR and FMDTA on the DrugMAP dataset, achieving the
lowest RMSE (1.597) and the highest CI (0.762). The integration of vast
domain knowledge into KB-BERT, including physicochemical attributes
and bioactivity data, provides a deep contextual understanding of
molecular semantics. Fingerprint-based augmentation further enriches
semantic representations to better capture structure-function relationships. This enhances generalization and provides superior embedding
of properties that influence drug-target interactions.


_4.3. The impact of different graph structure models_


To evaluate the performance of graph structure models in representing the SMILES molecular formula, we conducted experiments
comparing our G-K BertDTA with state-of-the-art models such as GCN,
GAT, and GAT_GCN. Experimental results are presented in Table 7 and
Fig. 9. GCN is limited in its ability to handle dynamic graphs in the
3D environment of SMILES molecular formulas. Since many molecular
graphs are dynamic, GCN‚Äôs applicability is limited. Furthermore, the
symmetric convolution kernel of GCN cannot accommodate asymmetric
graph structures, which can lead to performance degradation when
processing certain asymmetric molecular structures. For GAT, it was
observed that the model neglects global information, and only focuses
on the attention mechanisms of neighboring nodes. This can lead to
an incomplete understanding of the overall molecular graph structure
and features. As for GAT_GCN, the model heavily relies on neighboring
nodes, and the convolution operation of GCN depends on them. If
the feature representation of neighboring nodes is incorrect or noisy,
GAT_GCN might prioritize non-significant nodes, which can negatively
impact the overall model performance. The GIN isomorphic graph
neural network demonstrated superior performance in learning the
graph structures of SMILES molecular formulas.
GIN outperforms other GNNs in extracting features from SMILES
molecular formulas for DTA (Drug-Target Affinity) prediction. From a
structural feature perspective, the expression of SMILES molecular formulas is highly unique, and general GNNs often overlook the effective

extraction of structural features. GIN excels in capturing the features
of isomorphic SMILES molecular formulas and learning the structural
relationships between formulas with similar properties in higher dimensions. This is due to the integrity of SMILES molecular formulas in
terms of structure, where even minor differences in atomic bonds can
lead to distinct chemical properties. GIN can handle molecular formulas
of any structure and shape, with a greater emphasis on learning the
overall structure within the graphical format compared to other GNNs.
In addition, as node labels are typically manually defined and subject to
errors and uncertainties, GIN‚Äôs independence from node labels allows it
to effectively minimize the loss caused by missing or inaccurate labels.
Consequently, utilizing GIN enhances the accuracy of DTA prediction.


_4.4. The impact of different representation learning processes_


We test the impact of the three representational learning processes
through ablations. Firstly, we removed the learning of SMILES molecular formula features. These features do not adequately capture the
chemical structure and properties of the molecule. Consequently, the
omission of SMILES molecular formula features may result in the loss
of crucial molecular information. Subsequently, we exclusively exclude
the learning of protein features. This exclusion noticeably impacts the
interpretability of the model‚Äôs predictions and hinders its understanding
of how to predict DTA.
Moreover, we solely remove the extraction of semantic information. The substantial decline in the model‚Äôs performance serves as
evidence that semantic information plays a vital role in drug-target
affinity research, encompassing aspects such as chemical structure and
biological function. Additionally, we conduct various ablation experiments, confirming the significant contribution of the protein structural
features, SMILES molecular structural features, and molecular semantic
information features in enhancing the model‚Äôs predictive capabilities.
Experimental results are presented in Table 8 and Fig. 10.



_Computers in Biology and Medicine 173 (2024) 108376_


**Fig. 10.** Performance evaluation of different representation learning components. The
combination of all three components (protein, graph, and semantic features) achieves
the best result, demonstrating the vital contribution of each to drug-target affinity
prediction.


_4.5. Influence of different semantic information feature extraction model_


We evaluate the influence of various models for extracting semantic
information features, as well as different pre-training knowledge bases.
The baselines are SOTA NLP models. The results are presented in
Table 9 and Fig. 11.
_**BERT**_ [34], a state-of-the-art language model, employs a bidirectional transformer architecture. It achieves remarkable performance in
diverse NLP tasks by pre-training on extensive text data and fine-tuning
for specific applications. In this work, the BERT processes SMILES
formulas into text format, concatenates the features of each word in
the text together, and fornfsrcms a vector that represents the semantic

information of the entire SMILES formula.

_**Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)**_ [100] leverages the
transformer architecture. With its autoregressive nature and self-attention mechanisms, it demonstrates impressive capabilities in text generation and can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP applications.
During our experiment, it takes SMILES formulas processed by chemical
informatics tools RDKit as input, encodes the text information based on
the transformer encoder, extracts features to predict the information of
the next word, and fine-tunes the model based on downstream tasks to
adapt to the feature extraction of SMILES formulas.

_**Knowledge-based BERT-WCL semantic model**_ [101] is trained using a data augmentation method called multiple SMILES strings, which
involves representing the same molecule in various ways, and is commonly used in molecular property prediction.
_**Knowledge-based BERT-CHIRAL1**_ utilizes pre-training molecular
tasks and acquires knowledge of MACCS fingerprint maps.
_**Knowledge-based BERT-RS**_ employs another pre-training molecular
task and gains proficiency in molecular chirality maps, generating
corresponding semantic models.
Our findings demonstrate the significant contribution of the acquired external knowledge base to the extraction of semantic information. Additionally, the impact of various language models on enhancing

feature effectiveness for semantic information feature extraction is

found to be negligible. Thus, a comparably computationally efficient

_4.6. Case study_


To demonstrate the predictive performance of our method, we
selected 5 drugs (D1‚ÄìD5) and 5 targets (T1‚ÄìT5) and generated affinity
data between them. Fig. 12 is a 5 √ó 5 affinity matrix, with color depth
indicating affinity strength. The heatmap clearly shows that D5 has
the strongest binding affinity towards T1 (0.98), while D4 binds most
weakly to T2 (0.02). Our model can effectively predict binding levels
between new drug-target pairs, which is crucial for drug development

and disease treatment.

To demonstrate the predictive performance of our model, we selected 20 drugs from the Davis and KIBA datasets and generated
synthetic ground-truth affinity data between them and targets. We then

made predictions with our model and showed the comparison between
true and predicted affinities. As shown in Fig. 13, our model achieves
consistently accurate affinity predictions across the 20 drugs. The consistently high accuracy and strong correlation with ground truth data
across different drugs demonstrate the reliability and generalization
capability of the model. Our framework has promising potential to aid
novel drug discovery and repurposing.


_4.7. Discussion_


Our proposed G-K BertDTA framework demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance in predicting drug-target binding affinity across diverse
datasets. The representation learning processes effectively capture complementary information on protein sequences, molecular structures,
and semantics. The DenseSENet extracts hierarchical features from

target proteins by densely connecting convolutional blocks and reusing
prior outputs. This allows comprehensive sequence coverage without
loss of information across layers. The SE blocks further recalibrate
channel-wise feature importance to focus on salient signatures dictating
binding behavior. For drug compounds, the GIN network overcomes issues with missing node labels by learning topological graph patterns instead of discrete semantics. It generalizes well across varied molecular
structures while still embedding critical chemical features. Subsequent
CNN dimensionality reduction concentrates embeddings on key properties influencing activity. The knowledge-infused KB-BERT encodes a
rich context of physicochemical attributes and bioactivity data through
pre-training. This equips the model with an improved understanding of structure-function relationships to better predict interactions.
Fingerprint-based augmentation also boosts generalization.
While integrated components like GIN, DenseNet, and KB-BERT
entail computational complexity, our design choices target efficiency.
The GIN graph isomorphism approach avoids expensive node label
processing. DenseNet requires fewer layers relative to conventional
CNNs through feature reuse. Squeeze-excitation focuses on activations
to mitigate extraneous operations. For BERT, we employ keypoint
pre-training instead of full fine-tuning.
We also apply high-performance computing resources, including
an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs and 64 GB system memory, to enable
parallel execution. The batch size, sequence lengths, and neural network depths have been optimized to balance accuracy and speed.
Overall, the unified multi-view representation learning and interaction
framework enhances affinity prediction accuracy. While deep networks
provide modeling capacity, moderate dataset sizes raise bias concerns
without proper regularization. We mitigated overfitting through early

stopping, dropout (0.1), data augmentation, and train/validation/test
splits (70%/10%/20%) for cross-validation. This assesses unseen generalization to new drug-target pairs, reducing bias. Our approach sets
new benchmarks across datasets and has promising applicability for
drug discovery. Future work can explore dynamic graph modeling and
adaptive network architectures for each component.


**5. Conclusion**


We present G-K BertDTA, a novel framework for predicting drugtarget affinity between drugs and targets. Our approach leverages
three representation learning processes: protein structure feature extraction to extract the representation information of protein molecules;
graph neural network representation learning of SMILES molecular,
and semantic information representation learning of molecules through
knowledge-based BERT. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art affinity
prediction models, such as DeepDTA and GraphDTA, demonstrating significantly improved performance. Future work includes enhancing the
graph neural network to incorporate mechanisms for distinguishing the
importance of different node features and enhancing the flexibility and
performance of the DenseSE Net, thus further improving the model‚Äôs
performance.
